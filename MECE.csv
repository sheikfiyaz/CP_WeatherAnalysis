High Humidity & Moderate Temperature - leads to overcast or cloudy conditions.
Low Humidity & High Temperature - minimal chances of precipitation.
High Humidity & High Temperature - muggy and uncomfortable conditions
Rapid Temperature Drop - result in freezing rain or sleet."

Mid-Altitude - Close to baseline",,"High Pressure System (1015 hPa to 1030 hPa) - Clear skies, dry and stable weather, light winds, and reduced precipitation.
Low-Pressure System (990 hPa to 1010 hPa ) - Cloudy skies, precipitation, strong winds, and the potential for stormy weather.
Cold Front (3 to 7 hPa or more over a few hours) - hunderstorms, heavy rainfall, strong winds, and a drop in temperature.
Warm Front (1 to 3 hPa or less per hour) -  overcast skies, drizzle, light to moderate rainfall, and a slow increase in temperature.
Stationary Front (less than 3 hPa over a short time period) - overcast skies, drizzle, light rain, and inconsistent winds."

Spring",,?T = ? (T1 - T2) / n,,"Dew Point Temperature - Higher dew point temperatures indicate more moisture in the air.
Relative Humidity - Relative humidity values close to 100% indicate air that is nearly saturated, while values closer to 0% indicate very dry conditions. 
Effect of Temperature on Humidity - Warmer air can hold more moisture than colder air."
